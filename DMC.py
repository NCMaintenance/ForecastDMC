### How to Run This Application Locally:

1.  **Save the code:** Copy the entire code block above and save it as a Python file (e.g., `timesfm_app.py`) on your local machine.

2.  **Install necessary libraries:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas numpy
    ```
    **For actual TimesFM functionality, you will also need the `timesfm` library.** Please refer to Google's official documentation or GitHub for `timesfm` for the most accurate installation instructions. A common command might be:
    ```bash
    pip install timesfm
    # If timesfm is part of transformers, it might be:
    # pip install transformers
    ```
    *(Note: The exact installation and usage of TimesFM might depend on its current release status and API. You may need to download pre-trained weights or configure access to a Google Cloud service like Vertex AI.)*

3.  **Run the Streamlit app:** In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved `timesfm_app.py` and run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run timesfm_app.py
    ```
    This will open the application in your web browser. Upload your `may.xlsx - Sheet1.csv` file, select your columns, and set the forecast horizon.
